# Vanilla JS DOM Manipulation Challenge

## Overview
This project was created as a practice exercise to strengthen my skills in DOM manipulation using vanilla JavaScript. The focus was on dynamically creating and managing all elements programmatically without relying on pre-written HTML. The styling was added to make the project visually appealing but was not the primary goal.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: The project is dynamically constructed using JavaScript, but HTML5 forms the foundational document structure.
- **CSS3**: Minimal styling is applied to make the interface visually appealing.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: All DOM manipulation, element creation, and interactivity are handled entirely with pure JavaScript, without libraries or frameworks.

## Features
- **Dynamic Element Creation**: All elements are generated and manipulated entirely with JavaScript, showcasing fundamental DOM manipulation techniques.
- **Minimal Viable Product (MVP)**: This project was built in just two hours, as a game itself.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: While styling was not the main focus, basic CSS was added to enhance the user experience and make the application more engaging.

## Purpose
This project served as a quick, hands-on challenge to improve my proficiency in JavaScript and understanding of the DOM API. It emphasizes:
- Writing clean, concise JavaScript code. (Although I know it can be improved)
- Using JavaScript to dynamically handle content and structure.
- Building a working prototype in a short time.

## Future Improvements
Given more time, I would consider:
- Enhancing the design with more advanced CSS or animations.
- Adding new features or interactivity.
- Refactoring the code for better modularity and scalability, for sure.

## Contribution
This project is a simple practise exercise, but I encourage you to fork it and make changes! Whether it's improving the design, adding new features, or refactoring the code, feel free to experiment and make it your own.

If you do fork the project and make updates, I'd love to see your version! Don't hesitate to share it.
